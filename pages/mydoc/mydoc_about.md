{% include image.html file="Jamezy_Smiling.png"  alt="JFS" caption="James F Stevenson" %} My name is James Stevenson, and I'm a technical writer, blogger, and IoT fanatic based in Niort, France. For more details, see my [technical writing freelance site](http://www.documentus.co.uk).

I have used this theme to show my portfolio and experience with documentation projects. This site has undergone several major iterations as I develop on the fly, and now it's fairly complete and has all the features that I need. You are welcome to comment and add suggestions which may improve the UX.

I think this theme does pretty much everything that you can do with something like OxygenXML, but without the constraints of structured authoring. Everything is completely open and changeable, so if you start tinkering around with the theme's files, you can break things. But it's completely empowering as well!

With a completely open architecture and code base, you can modify the code to make it do exactly what you want, without having to jump through all kinds of confusing or proprietary code.

If there's a feature you need but it isn't available here, let me know and I might add it. Alternatively, if you fork the theme, I would love to see your modifications and enhancements. Thanks for using Jekyll.
